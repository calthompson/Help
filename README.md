# Help!

## About

Help! is a Yelp Fusion application that allows users to search for restaurants in and around Cleveland. It began as a senior programming project, but it has been expanded with more functionalities.

## Setup

To use Help!, you will need a local server that supports PHP. I used WAMPserver for testing on my local machine.

### Getting an API Key

To make use of the Yelp Fusion API, you need an API key. You can get one by making a Yelp account and starting here: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started

For more information on authentication, you can go here: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication

After getting your API key, open up the app.ini file and paste the key between the quotes of the "api-key" line. Save the file, and you should be goot to go.
