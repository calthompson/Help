# Help!

## About

Help! is a Yelp Fusion application that allows users to search for restaurants in and around Cleveland. It began as a senior programming project, but it has been expanded with more functionalities.

## Setup

To use Help!, you will need a local server that supports PHP. I used WAMPserver for testing on my local machine.

### Getting an API Key
